__Project: Weather Forecasting Tool__

As a weather enthusiast, you have decided to create a tool that can provide accurate weather forecasting information for a given location. Your goal is to develop a Python program that takes a user's location as input and outputs the expected weather conditions for the next few days.

__Inputs:__

User's location (in the form of a city or zip code)

__Outputs:__

The expected weather conditions for the next 3-5 days (including temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and any relevant weather alerts or warnings)

__Project Requirements:__

- Use an API to obtain weather data for the specified location. You can choose any API you like, such as OpenWeatherMap, Weather Underground, or AccuWeather.
- Parse the data returned by the API to extract the relevant weather information for the next 3-5 days.
- Display the weather forecast in a user-friendly way. You can choose to display the information in the terminal, or build a simple GUI using a Python library like Tkinter or PyQT.
- Handle errors gracefully. If the API returns an error, display a helpful error message to the user.

__Optional Enhancements:__

- Allow the user to specify the number of days they want to see the weather forecast for.
- Add support for multiple locations. Allow the user to save and retrieve weather forecasts for different locations.
- Include a graphical representation of the weather conditions, such as a chart or a map.
- Provide recommendations for appropriate clothing or activities based on the weather conditions.

*Good luck with your project!* ðŸ¥³
